# Hangman Game

This was a project that was created to introduce the software interns into classes and functions. 

This week your task is to develop a hangman game.

* When ran, the code must use the [random-word library](https://pypi.org/project/Random-Word/) to come up with a word. *Use the attachment to see how to install the library*
* Once the word has been generated, the code must prompt the user to enter a letter to guess the word.
* The user has 11 tries to guess the word. If they are unable to guess the word, they will loose the game.
* The game must keep track of the guessed words and must alert the user if the word has already been guessed.
* The game must show placeholders for the letters that have not been guessed and show the actual letter if it has already been guessed.

Bonus:
* Keep track of users guess accuracy 

This will require some extra research on arrays and lists, to make life easier.



While this game can be created using only if/else statements, I highly recommend that you use Classes to create the game. It will allow you to understand the potential of classes.
